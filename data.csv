966,Where does red soil develop?,Red soil develops on crystalline igneous rocks in areas of low rainfall in the eastern and southern parts of the Deccan plateau.
967,What causes the reddish color in red and yellow soils?,These soils develop a reddish colour due to diffusion of iron in crystalline and metamorphic rocks.
